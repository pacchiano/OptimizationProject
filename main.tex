\section{Project}

This project will focus on understanding recent approaches to study the continuous-time limit of ``accelerated'' optimization algorithms \cite{su2014differential, wibisono2016variational, krichene2015accelerated}. After
the literature review we will hopefully be able to experiment with deriving different optimizers (using different numerical discretization schemes) of the continuous-time formulations.

\section{Background}
% Gradient descent update
First order methods for solving convex optimization problems in the form
\[\min f(x)\]
are popular for large data sets and problems. Gradient descent is a common such method, dating back to Euler and Lagrange. It takes the form of an update rule
\[x_{k+1} = x_k - s \nabla f(x_k)\]
starting from an initial point $x_0$. Nesterov proposed an accelerated gradient method  (cite original Nesterov paper 1983), which takes the following form: starting with $x_0$ and $y_0 = x_0$ inductively define

\begin{align*}
    x_k &= y_{k-1} - s \nabla f(y_{k-1})\\
    y_k &= x_k + \frac{k-1}{k+2} (x_k - x_{k-1}).
\end{align*}

For any fixed step size $s \leq \frac{1}{L}$ where $L$ is the Lipschitz constant of $\nabla f$, it has a convergence rate of:
 
\begin{equation}
f(x_k) - f^* \leq O \left(\frac{\|x_0 - x^*\|^2}{sk^2} \right)
\end{equation}
which is optimal among first order methods (cite wherever this was shown -- Nesterov, 2004)

This accelerate are notable applications in sparse linear regression, compressed sensing, and deep/recurrent neural networks (cite?).
